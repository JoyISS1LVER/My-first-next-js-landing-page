## How its created and what was used...

I used Next JS React. just a basic startup page with all the functionalities from
1. Responsive for smartphones and pc .
2. Responsive navbar with hamburger menu for smartphone navigation
3. Responsive buttons to navigate through whole website with smooth scrolling.
4. Video section which features a video to represent our service or product.
5. Testimonial and Payment section is used with carousel feature, Thus its easy to swipe/drag to change between each cards.
6. Our Team section with individual pictures with social media handlers.
